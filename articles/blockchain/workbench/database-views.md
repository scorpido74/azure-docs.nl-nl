# <a name="azure-blockchain-workbench-database-views"></a>Azure Blockchain Workbench database views

Azure Blockchain Workbench Preview delivers data from distributed ledgers to an *off-chain* SQL DB database. The off-chain database makes it possible to use SQL and existing tools, such as [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017), to interact with blockchain data.

Azure Blockchain Workbench provides a set of database views that provide access to data that will be helpful when performing your queries. These views are heavily denormalized to make it easy to quickly get started building reports, analytics, and otherwise consume blockchain data with existing tools and without having to retrain database staff.

This section includes an overview of the database views and the data they contain.

> [!NOTE]
> Any direct usage of database tables found in the database outside of these views, while possible, is not supported.
